"""Binary capability-delta supply-chain detector.

When a dep bumps from version X to version Y and the deliverable is
a *binary artifact* (Docker FROM layer, GHA Docker-action image,
pre-built binary release pin), the source diff isn't the right
signal — the payload is in the binary, not the source tree. This
detector runs :mod:`packages.binary_analysis.radare2_understand`
against both the current and target binaries, diffs their
capability surfaces, and emits a :class:`SupplyChainFinding` when
the target adds dangerous capabilities the current didn't have.

What's a "capability"? Two signals:

  * **Dangerous imports** — ``execve`` / ``recv`` / ``CreateProcess``
    / etc. The shared :mod:`core.function_taxonomy` defines the
    high-CVE-density buckets (exec, network, format-string,
    parser, etc.); the detector treats *any new entry* in those
    buckets as a capability addition.
  * **Reachable dangerous sinks** — functions in the binary that
    cross-reference any dangerous import. A new sink means the
    binary has new *code* that uses a dangerous capability, even
    if the import list looks unchanged.

Severity ladder
  * Adds *exec* capability → ``high``  (RCE-flavoured)
  * Adds *network ingestion* capability → ``high`` (exfil-flavoured)
  * Adds any other dangerous capability → ``medium``

Out of scope
  * Path resolution: callers supply already-extracted current /
    target binary paths (Docker layer extraction, OCI pull,
    release-artifact download). The detector is pure-comparison.
  * Removed capabilities: a bump that *drops* a dangerous import
    is rarely a red flag (often a security improvement). The
    detector ignores removals.
  * Source-only ecosystems: npm / PyPI / Cargo's payload is in the
    source tree; source-diff signals (install_hook_delta, etc.)
    cover those. The detector's natural callers are
    Dockerfile-FROM bumps, GHA Docker-action bumps, and binary-
    artifact pins.
