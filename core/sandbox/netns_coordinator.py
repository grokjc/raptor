"""Per-run coordinator for paired-process isolation in a shared netns.

Spawned as a subprocess by callers that need two sibling-sandboxed
processes to share a single isolated user-namespace + network-namespace.
Reads a JSON request from stdin describing the two commands, sets up the
shared namespaces, forks both children (each inheriting the shared
namespaces via the fork), waits for both, writes a JSON response to
stdout, exits.

Architecture rationale. The naïve substrate — two sandbox.run calls each
``setns()``-ing into a shared netns fd — has two fundamental problems on
real Linux hosts:

  1. ``setns(fd, CLONE_NEWNET)`` requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the user-ns
     that owns the netns. An unprivileged sandbox child doesn't have
     that, so setns silently fails and each sandbox.run creates its own
     private netns — sharing does not actually happen.

  2. To make setns work the sandbox child needs BOTH a user-ns fd and a
     net-ns fd, kept open across exec. Those fds are permission tokens —
     adversarial code in the sandbox could ``setns()`` them to re-enter
     the shared user-ns and gain caps over the shared netns.

The coordinator pattern avoids both: the two children are FORKS of the
coordinator, so they inherit the user-ns and net-ns by the kernel's normal
fork-inheritance mechanism. No setns call, no namespace fd inside the
sandbox.

Two paths for namespace setup:

  A. Direct unshare from this script. Works on hosts where the operator
     has disabled the LSM restriction
     (``kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`` on Ubuntu, or the
     distro's equivalent). Tried first.

  B. Via the privileged launcher binary at
     ``core/sandbox/helpers/raptor-coord-launcher``. The launcher creates
     the namespaces in a brief privileged window, drops every capability,
     and execs THIS script with ``RAPTOR_COORD_FROM_LAUNCHER=1`` set. The
     script then proceeds as if it had done the unshare itself.

If both paths fail, the script writes a structured error to stdout and
exits non-zero. The caller surfaces the message to the operator.

JSON protocol — see ``core/sandbox/_netns_protocol.py``.

    Why launcher-first: a failed direct attempt under an LSM-hardened
