"""Operator-annotation populator for LabeledAttempt records.

Operator-driven mutator for the
failure-mode field on existing records, atomic + path-traversal defended.
"Populated by ... operator annotation (after-the-fact triage)."

Records are normally append-only. Annotation is the explicit
exception: an operator triaging a record can refine its
``failure_mode`` (or clear it) without producing a new record. The
write is atomic (write-temp + rename), and a consistency check
mirrors the dataclass's __post_init__ so the on-disk state can't
diverge from what construction would allow.

This is a thin, focused mutator — not a general-purpose record
editor. Use :func:`set_failure_mode` for the one supported field;
other fields stay immutable so the append-only assumption holds
for everything else.
