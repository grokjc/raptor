"""Synthetic-fixture corpus driver.

Uses the in-tree fixture at
``core/inventory/tests/fixtures/binary_oracle/`` with hand-labeled
expected verdicts. No external deps; validates the precision harness
end-to-end on known-correct cases and acts as a fast classifier sanity
check.

The fold case (``folded_a``/``folded_b``) probes the classifier
directly to determine the expected verdict. Fold detection is DWARF-
based (``DW_AT_low_pc`` collisions); nm symbol addresses may disagree
when the linker merges code but doesn't update DWARF entries (observed
with GNU ld ``--icf=safe``).
